# DDC/CI
This is a Java tool for controlling monitors via DDC/CI. It is meant to be usable across multiple platforms, given that one provides an implementation using a Service Provider Interface.

Currently, only Windows is supported (and tested only under Windows 8.1). Furthermore, the projectname is rather meaningless, one can therefore expect it to change in the future.
